# 🌸 DailyHaiku – Frontend UI

**DailyHaiku** is a minimalist web interface that displays a new haiku every day, integrating frontend design with backend content automation. The project was built to explore how to deliver micro-content elegantly and efficiently, using modern frontend tools and clean UX practices.

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this project was to build a frontend experience that feels lightweight, poetic, and fluid — while integrating seamlessly with a dynamic backend. The focus was on speed, clarity, and simplicity, delivering one core piece of content: a haiku per day.
